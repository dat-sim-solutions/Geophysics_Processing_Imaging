FWI (Full-Waveform Inversion):  
It is a high resolution seismic imaging technique for velocity and density  
Forward simulation (using the acustic wave equation), comparison against syntetic data, optimizing of the Velocity matrix.  

Magnetic Susceptibility:
It is a magnetic technique for magnetic susceptibility.
Forward simulation (using the general Green's function for the vertical magnetic field), comparison against syntetic data,  
optimizing of the magnetic susceptibility matrix.  

Petrophysics correlation
Both techniques are combined to give a higher resolution.
